Description: JSON.parse() with context information on error
 This is a Node.js library for getting nicer errors out of JSON.parse(),
 including context and position of parse errors.
 .
 It servers similar purpose as the JSON.parse method but returns more useful
 errors when exceptions happen.
 .
 It's really fast, really good at concurrency, and it will never give you
 corrupted data, even if cache files get corrupted or manipulated.
 .
 It was originally written to be used as npm's local cache, but
 can just as easily be used on its own
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
